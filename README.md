# Models database
This repository contains some .json files, used from the [online-application](https://numerosu.github.io/online-application/numero).

In order to add new files, convert them to .json with the [python script "meshtojson.py"](https://github.com/NumeroSU/online-application/releases) in the application release.

Also, think about  updating the [list.csv](https://github.com/NumeroSU/models-database/blob/master/list.csv) file (which should be put away in the future).

Requests are made from the application to this repository github pages as .json files, such as [https://numerosu.github.io/models-database/A_canthare.json](https://numerosu.github.io/models-database/A_canthare.json)
